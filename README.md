# hsolver

historically short for hex-solver, this tool can parse simple mathematical expressions with support for binary (0b), octal (0o) and hexadecimal (0x) numbers.

commands:
- `list`: list all functions (including parameter count) and variables (including value) in current context
- `hex`/`oct`/`bin` set output format (also inline, i.e. `bin 0x40+0x40` or `0x40+0x40 bin`)
